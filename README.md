# Coding Test Solutions

This test is solved using **Java programming language**.

All source code files are included separately:
- Program-1.java
- Program-2.java
- Program-3.java
- Program-4.java

## Programming Language:
Java  
Version Used: JDK 8+

## File Descriptions:

### Program-1.java
- Simple Calculator program using a class
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Inputs: a, b, and operation type

### Program-2.java
- Prints the first 'a' odd numbers
- Example:  
  a = 3 → 1, 3, 5

### Program-3.java
- Prints odd number sequence based on whether input 'a' is even or odd
- If a is even → prints odd numbers till (a - 1) * 2  
- If a is odd → prints odd numbers till a * 2

### Program-4.java
- Problem: Count how many numbers in the array are divisible by digits 1 to 9
- Given array: {1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30}
- Output format: {1: count, 2: count, ..., 9: count}
- Logic:
  - Loop through array
  - Check divisibility (num % i == 0)
  - Maintain count for digits 1 to 9
